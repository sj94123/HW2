How to Run the Codes - 

A) For Ruby and Go code 

1. Click on the DOI of repl.it in the readme

2. Now click on the .replit file in the files explorer and paste -
  
  (i) for Go - 
      
      language = "go"
      run = "go run code/gol.go"
   
  (ii) for Ruby -
     
     language = "ruby"
      run = "ruby life.rb"
      
B) For SQL code

Use SQLFiddle: http://sqlfiddle.com/#!17
   
Copy the SQL code onto the Schema Panel, build schema.

You can check the output in a tabular format by querying

      SELECT * FROM output order by ID;
